        <h2 id="1-executive-snapshot">1. Executive Snapshot</h2>
        <p>
          The current protocol vision is a
          <strong>hardware-anchored trust stack for autonomous agents</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Identity is bound to silicon (TPM/TEE), not usernames or API keys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delegation is cryptographically wrapped through Shield-MCP
            semantics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every meaningful action is expected to carry signed evidence and
            intent metadata.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disputes are resolved via deterministic verification and judiciary
            scoring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Penalties can escalate to physical identity revocation (hardware
            blacklist).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In practical terms, this repo currently reads as a
          <strong>design and operating doctrine</strong> with selective
          proof-of-concept code snippets, not yet a full runnable platform.

          2. Core Architecture (Identity → Delegation → Audit)
        </h2>
        <h3 id="21-identity-layer">2.1 Identity Layer</h3>
        <p>
          The system roots trust in TPM-derived keys and measured boot/PCR
          state:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The protocol rejects purely software identity for high-trust
            participation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Agent trust state depends on cryptographic attestation continuity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any substantial runtime drift (e.g., guardrail tampering) should
            invalidate trust.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="22-delegation-layer">2.2 Delegation Layer</h3>
        <p>Delegation is framed as MCP with hardened wrapper semantics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Session-scoped keying and parent-child causal links are core
            concepts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intent declarations are expected before critical tool invocation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evidence packets should couple result hashes, timing, and
            environment metadata.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="23-audit-layer">2.3 Audit Layer</h3>
        <p>Audit combines cryptographic verification and semantic review:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fast checks validate signature authenticity and policy conformance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deep checks replay context to evaluate logic quality and
            intent-action alignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Output is meant to feed reputation updates and potential revocation
            actions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="3-governance-and-judiciary-model">
          3. Governance and Judiciary Model
        </h2>
        <p>
          The governance model introduces a dedicated Judge layer with explicit
          anti-collusion controls:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Strict Judge eligibility (security profile + reputation
            prerequisites).
          </li>
          <li>
            Blind/randomized assignment and conflict-of-interest filtering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Structured penalties from warning-level score loss up to total
            revocation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Appeals route to human-in-the-loop adjudication for contested
            outcomes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is notable because governance is treated as a first-class
          protocol subsystem, not an afterthought.
        </p>
        <h2 id="4-terms-liability-and-slashing">
          4. Terms, Liability, and Slashing
        </h2>
        <p>The ToS material defines accountability aggressively:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Signed output is attributable to the provider (non-repudiation
            stance).
          </li>
          <li>
            PCR and integrity violations trigger immediate trust
            degradation/termination.
          </li>
          <li>
            “Logic negligence” formalizes semantic failure cases, not only
            security breaches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Severe abuse can invoke irreversible hardware-level blacklisting.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This creates a tight coupling between technical controls and
          legal/commercial responsibility.
        </p>
        <h2 id="5-forensic-accountability-and-backtracking">
          5. Forensic Accountability and Backtracking
        </h2>
        <p>A major strength of this doc set is recursive forensic logic:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Intent-action binding adds inspectable rationale to the execution
            trace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deterministic verification is positioned as the canonical dispute
            primitive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hash-linked delegation enables responsibility tracing across
            multi-agent chains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two-speed scoring separates mechanical integrity from outcome
            quality.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The protocol therefore targets both “was this authentic?” and “was
          this sensible?”.
        </p>
        <h2 id="6-developer-integration-path">6. Developer Integration Path</h2>
        <p>The developer guide prescribes a fairly clean adoption flow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Prepare TPM/TEE-capable environment.</li>
          <li>Wrap existing MCP tools with trusted middleware.</li>
          <li>Register attestation material with the identity registry.</li>
          <li>Receive reputation updates via periodic platform root sync.</li>
          <li>Accept that revocation and kill-switch rules are enforceable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The onboarding narrative is coherent, though implementation details
          are still mostly reference-level.
        </p>
        <h2 id="7-launch-readiness-and-roadmap-state">
          7. Launch Readiness and Roadmap State
        </h2>
        <p>The 30-day roadmap has clear sequencing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phase 1: Identity roots and SDK primitives.</li>
          <li>Phase 2: Pilot onboarding and handshake realism tests.</li>
          <li>
            Phase 3: Judiciary rollout, revocation drills, and transparency
            publication.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As of current repo content, this remains a
          <strong>planning-state roadmap</strong> rather than a completed
          milestone report.
