          WHITE PAPER: THE SILICON TRUST PROTOCOL (STP)
        </h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Sub-title:</strong> A Framework for Verifiable AI Delegation
          and Forensic Semantic Accountability<br />
          <strong>Date:</strong> February 16, 2026<br />
          <strong>Status:</strong> Extended Technical Specification v1.2

        <h2 id="1-executive-summary">1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
          As AI agents move from advisory roles to autonomous executors, the
          "Trust Gap" has become the primary inhibitor of the Agentic Web.
          Current software-only security models are susceptible to identity
          spoofing, non-deterministic failure, and "Responsibility Drift."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Silicon Trust Protocol (STP) introduces a hardware-anchored
          security stack that binds AI agent identity to Trusted Platform
          Modules (TPM), utilizes Model Context Protocol (MCP) for secure
          tool-use, and implements a Deterministic Forensic Replay system for
          retroactive semantic auditing.

          2. THE PROBLEM: THE SEMANTIC GAP &amp; IDENTITY SPOOFING
        </h2>
        <p>
          The transition to autonomous delegation faces three existential risks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Sybil Proliferation:</strong> The near-zero cost of spinning
            up unverified agents leads to reputation gaming.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Black Box Execution:</strong> Current delegation chains
            lack a "Flight Data Recorder," making it impossible to diagnose why
            an agent made a catastrophic decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transient Accountability:</strong> Without hardware binding,
            a malicious agent can "reset" its identity after a failure, evading
            penalties.
          </li>
        </ul>

          3.1 Pillar I: Hardware-Anchored Identity (The Root)
        </h3>
        <p>Identity is not a software attribute; it is a physical constant.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>TPM Binding:</strong> Every agent ID is derived from the TPM
            Endorsement Key (EK).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Measured Boot (PCRs):</strong> The system state (OS, Python
            environment, model weights) is hashed into Platform Configuration
            Registers. If the agent's code is modified to bypass safety filters,
            the PCRs change, and the TPM refuses to sign outgoing messages.
          </li>

          Delegation is handled via a hardened MCP wrapper that enforces
          session-based security.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Session Leases:</strong> Agents negotiate temporary,
            TPM-signed session keys for high-speed tool calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Causal Linking:</strong> Every sub-task includes a hash of
            the parent instruction, creating an immutable "Chain of Command"
            across multiple agents.

          To bridge the gap between "technical correctness" and "semantic
          wisdom," STP implements retroactive accountability.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Reasoning Snapshots:</strong> Agents must log an "Intent
            Declaration" before executing tool calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deterministic Verification:</strong> Forensic investigators
            can re-run the agent’s logic in a sandboxed digital twin to verify
            if a decision was a "Reasonable Logic Error" or "Malicious
            Deviation."

          7. CONCLUSION: THE FUTURE OF MACHINE TRUST
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Silicon Trust Protocol moves the AI industry away from "Blind
          Trust" and toward "Verifiable Integrity." By anchoring agents in
          silicon and holding them accountable through forensic replay, it
          creates the necessary infrastructure for the multi-trillion-dollar
          Agentic Web.
